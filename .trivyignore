# Litestream v0.3.13 is the latest release (Dec 2023) but built with older Go versions.
# These vulnerabilities are in the Go standard library of the binary, not our application code.
# We accept these risks as we cannot rebuild Litestream easily and they are mostly related to
# functionality (SSH, net/netip) that is less critical for our S3 replication use case.
